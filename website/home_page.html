   About
   </h2>
   <p>
   The goal of this project is to design a system to aid visually impaired or blind individuals
   in navigating the world around them. The project aims to build a device that would act as a 
   natural augmentation to the userâ€™s existing ability to navigate using spatialized audio cues 
   from the world around them.

   System Overview
   </h2>
   <img border="0" src="Resources/device.jpg" width="500">
   <p>
   The prototype system is comprised of a stripped down Mircosoft Kinect camera attached to a bicycles helmet for wear-ability. The Kinect will then be plugged into a laptop in a backpack. The laptop will preform all computation and output the audio through a set of headphones to the user.
